# Car Accident Detection and Bluetooth Controlled Car

This repository contains two Arduino-based projects aimed at enhancing vehicle safety and control:

1. **Car Accident Detection, GPS, and Alert System**: Detects car accidents using an accelerometer, retrieves location via GPS, and sends emergency alerts via GSM.
2. **Bluetooth Controlled Four Wheel Car**: A remotely controlled car using Bluetooth communication to navigate in multiple directions.

## Repository Structure
- `Car_Accident_Detection/`: Contains code, documentation, and libraries for the accident detection system.
- `Bluetooth_Controlled_Car/`: Contains code, documentation, and libraries for the Bluetooth-controlled car.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for the project.
- Circuit diagrams are included in the respective `docs/` folders.

## Prerequisites
- **Arduino IDE**: For uploading sketches to the microcontrollers.
- **Libraries**: Listed in `libraries.txt` files for each project.
- **Hardware**: Refer to the `documentation.md` files for equipment lists.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Navigate to the desired project folder (`Car_Accident_Detection` or `Bluetooth_Controlled_Car`).
3. Follow the setup instructions in the respective `documentation.md` files.
4. Upload the `.ino` sketches to the respective microcontrollers (NodeMCU for accident detection, Arduino Uno for the car).
5. Test the systems as described in the documentation.
